# Evolution-Algorithm

## Description:
Used genetic algorithms to find optimal solutions to well-known problems such as Knapsack and TSP, with a combination of different crossover techniques and truncation methods. 

Modified fitness function and crossover technique to tailor the implementation for evolving a reference image using Polygons, with the fitness function comparing each generated image to that of the goal and measuring the pixel distance between the two.
The algorithm was executed for the image of Mona Lisa, Facebook Logo, and Hugh Laurie.

## Requirements:
- Python Imaging Library
- Numpy
- MatplotLib
